# Danniel Dias Augusto

Mathematician with focus on structural clarity, explicit reasoning, and long-term maintainability.

My approach to software is guided by principles from mathematics: every concept must have well-defined scope before being referenced, structures should reveal their invariants explicitly, and abstractions should be justified by the problems they solve—not adopted by convention.

## What I work on

- Application architecture with emphasis on **explicit state modeling** and **separation of concerns**
- Data structure design guided by invariants rather than implementation convenience
- Mobile and web systems where **consistency** is a first-class requirement
- Linux-based development environments and tooling

I approach software problems the way I approach mathematical ones: by identifying the fundamental structure first, then building verifiable solutions on top of it.

## Technical interests

- **Declarative vs imperative paradigms**: how representation choices affect reasoning about correctness
- **Explicit modeling of state and transitions**: applying algebraic thinking to application domains
- **Architectural patterns that preserve invariants**: designing systems where constraints are enforced by structure, not discipline
- **Combinatorial algorithms and optimization**: bridging mathematical reasoning and practical performance
- Avoiding accidental complexity through careful abstraction

## Selected projects

**Laudamus**  
Mobile application for organizing and accessing liturgical chants, focused on simplicity, structure and clarity.  
Technologies: Flutter, Firebase  
→ https://laudamus.app

(Web version in development using the Angular framework)

*(Other projects are exploratory or experimental and reflect ongoing learning rather than finished products.)*

## Principles I care about

- **Explicit over implicit**: State, dependencies, and invariants should be visible
- **Structure over convention**: Constraints enforced by design, not documentation
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Code should reveal its reasoning, not hide it
- **Domain modeling first**: Understanding the problem space before choosing tools
- **Verifiable correctness**: Designing systems where properties can be reasoned about

These principles reflect my mathematical training: a theorem is only as strong as its proof, and a system is only as reliable as its invariants.
